# OptimalToLowerFunction #

How to take a string in C++ and change it so that all uppercase letters are now lowercase.

Please credit me if you decide to use this function. I've spent many years perfecting it.

# How to use my function in your code: #


- Copy `tolower.cc` and `tolower.h` into your projects directory.
- At the top of your program `#include "tolower.h"`
- Make sure to compile `tolower.cc` along with the rest of your code.
- Be merry.
  
# How to use the provided main function:
- Clone this repository.
- Deposit $50 into my bank account. (optional)
- Go into your terminal (no command prompty doesn't count) and find your way to your local copy of this repo.
- Type the word `make` and press enter. If you have trouble with that word just think `cake` then replace the c with an m.
- You should now have a new file called `magic_prog` in your directory. This is the program.
- I'll leave the rest as an exercise to the reader.

# FAQ
- *Why is it when I add `#include "tolower.h"` nothing happens and my IDE shows the line as a comment?*
Because you don't know the difference between C++ and Python
- *How did you derive this algorithm?*
Many years of procrastination and empty pringle containers.
- *Are people ** really ** asking you these questions or are you making this stuff up?*
Well uhm... time's up. That's all the time I have for today's Q/A. See you tomorrow folks.
